# Cloud Adoption Decision Support Tool

The Cloud Adoption Decision Support Tool (Cloud-DST) is an interactive, data-driven web application designed to help Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) navigate the complexities of digital transformation. Built with a focus on SMEs in Southwest Nigeria, this tool simplifies the transition from on-premise infrastructure to cloud-based solutions by providing a comprehensive readiness assessment, cost estimations, and personalized action plans. ☁️

## Overview
This project serves as a bridge between business requirements and technical cloud architecture. By analyzing factors such as team size, current IT infrastructure, data sensitivity, and budget, the application calculates a "Cloud Readiness Score" and generates a downloadable PDF roadmap. It is built using **React 19** and **Vite**, ensuring a high-performance, mobile-first experience.

## Features
- 📊 **Dynamic Scoring Engine**: A custom algorithm that evaluates business maturity and technical readiness.
- 💰 **Cost Estimator**: Real-time monthly IT budget forecasting based on local currency (NGN) and unit rates.
- 📋 **Multi-Category Assessment**: Detailed questionnaires covering IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and cybersecurity needs.
- 📑 **Report Generation**: Integration with `html2pdf.js` to allow users to export their cloud transition plan as a professional document.
- 📱 **Mobile-First UI**: A clean, "phone-frame" inspired design optimized for accessibility and ease of use.
- 🔒 **Compliance Mapping**: Identifies regulatory requirements like NDPR and GDPR based on industry selection.
